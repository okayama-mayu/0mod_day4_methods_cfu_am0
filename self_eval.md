# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
I feel ok about using built-in methods. I can google it if I'm not familiar and figure it out.

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
I am NOT confident with this part. I'm very confused about puts vs. prints vs. not using puts at all.

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
When do I use "puts" to call on a method? Why can't I use "puts" to call on a method I've defined earlier if the definition of the method includes "puts"? What's the difference between something a method "prints" and something a method "returns"?
